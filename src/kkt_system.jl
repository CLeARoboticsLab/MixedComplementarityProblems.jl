""" KKTSystem layer (GPU/batched solver).

This file defines the abstraction boundary described in `docs/gpu_kkt_design.md`.
The interior-point solver is written ONCE against a small verb set
`{residual!, jacobian!, factorize!, ldiv!}` plus generic batched array ops.
Everything regime-specific — the numeric representation of `∇F`, the device, and
the linear-solve algorithm — lives behind those verbs in a `KKTStrategy` and its
associated cache.

Two orthogonal axes:
  - `device`  : a KernelAbstractions backend (`CPU()`, `CUDABackend()`, …) that
                determines array type and where kernels run.
  - `strategy`: a `KKTStrategy` that determines the `∇F` representation and the
                linear solver used for it.

Invariant: `F` and the Newton step `δz` are plain `(d × B)` device arrays owned by
the SOLVER; the assembled `∇F` and its factorization never leave the cache. That
single invariant is what makes the strategies interchangeable.

Assemble `∇F` (with per-instance regularization `η`) into the cache's internal

applies `η` at the diagonal positions `cache.diag_nz`; `BatchedDense` scatters the
same `nnz` values into a zeroed `(d × d × B)`; `SparseSingle` fills a single
`(d × d)`. Whether `η` is applied internally (if the evaluator carries an `η` slot)
or additively on the diagonal is a per-strategy detail. [not yet implemented]

Factorize the batched system currently held in `cache`, leaving a factorization that
`ldiv!` reuses. `BatchedDense`: batched LU. `BatchedSparse`: numeric factorization

    ldiv!(out, cache, rhs)

Solve `∇F · out = rhs` for all instances, reusing the factorization from
`factorize!`. Both `out` and `rhs` are plain `(d × B)` device arrays.

The multi-rhs form used by parameter sensitivities is `(d × K × B)`, where
`K = nθ` is the number of parameters: per instance the system `∇F_z · (∂z/∂θ) =
-∇F_θ` has a `(d × K)` right-hand side `-∇F_θ` and a `(d × K)` solution `∂z/∂θ`.
The equation/variable axis `d` must lead (it is the row dimension of the `(d × d)`
solve), then the `K` right-hand sides, then the batch axis last. This keeps each
instance's `(d × K)` block contiguous in column-major memory and makes the
single-rhs `(d × B)` case the `K = 1` special case. [not yet implemented]
